# Blog Demo

## What is this application?

This is a contrived simulation of a blog application. Its purpose is not to be a blog, but to be a demonstration of the developer's programming skills.

### Who is the developer?

This application was developed by [Grant Lindsay](https://linkedin.com/in/grant-lindsay-us) (<abbr title="doing business as">d/b/a</abbr> Fast Dog Coding, LLC.)

## Is there a live version that I can see?

The live version is a work in progress, but feel free to take a look at [https://fastdogcoding.com/demo/](https://fastdogcoding.com/demo/).

## Can I copy this application for myself?

If you comply with the terms in the LICENSE, of course you may.

Reasons that someone may want to do that include learning from someone else's work, evaluating the skills of the programmer, or similar purposes.

It should go without saying that passing off this source code as one's own work would be wrong.

## Working with the Source Code
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.0.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

You will also need to run the companion application, the REST API Node.js application in this repository.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

### Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
